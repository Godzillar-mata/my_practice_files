### Data analyst on retail/whole sale company.
# Decision making to cancel some product from shelf.
key factors that I need to know are
1. % loss of that product.
2. % GP of that product.
some product may perform high % loss but if GP is greater that loss-coss of that product, I should let it continue sale on shelf.
for example product A : cost = 10, price = 15, %loss = 40% that mean if we have 10 pieces of product A we can sold it 6 and loss 4.
income = 6 * 15 = 90 , loss = 4 * 10 = 40 , total profit = 90 -40 = 50.
